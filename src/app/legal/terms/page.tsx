        <Section title="1. About Vuka Music">
          <p>Vuka Music ("we", "us", "the platform") is a digital music marketplace operated by Vuka Music Platform (Pty) Ltd (Registration pending, CIPC), Republic of South Africa. These Terms govern your use of vukamusic.com and all related services.</p>
          <p>By creating an account or making a purchase, you confirm you are at least 18 years old and agree to these Terms in full.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="2. User Accounts">
          <p>You are responsible for keeping your credentials secure. You may not share, sell, or transfer your account. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any account found to be in violation of these Terms.</p>
          <p>Artists must provide accurate information about themselves and the content they upload. Impersonation of another artist or person is prohibited.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="3. Content & Intellectual Property">
          <p>Artists retain full copyright ownership of all music, beats, and media uploaded to Vuka Music. By uploading, you grant Vuka Music a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to display, stream, and promote your content on the platform.</p>
          <p>You warrant that you own or have the right to sell all content you upload. Content that infringes third-party copyright, contains unlicensed samples, or violates any applicable law is prohibited and will be removed.</p>
          <p>Buyers receive a licence to use purchased content in accordance with the licence tier selected at checkout. Licences are non-transferable and do not grant ownership of the underlying copyright.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="4. Exclusive Licences">
          <p>When a buyer purchases an Exclusive Licence, that beat or content is permanently removed from sale. The artist may not re-list, re-sell, or grant any further licences for that specific work to any other party. This is a binding commitment enforced at the platform level.</p>
          <p>Exclusive licence purchases are final. No refunds are issued once the exclusive lock has been applied.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="5. Payments & Fees">
          <p>All prices are displayed in South African Rand (ZAR). Payments are processed via Paystack for domestic transactions. International payment options may be added in future.</p>
          <p>Vuka Music charges a platform fee on each transaction. Free accounts start at 10% and reduce automatically as lifetime sales grow — to 9% at R2,000 lifetime gross, and to 8.5% permanently above R10,000. Pro plan (R249/month) is charged at a flat 8%. Label plan (R999/month) is charged at a flat 5%. No additional fees are charged on crowdfunding or event sales. The applicable fee is deducted before funds are disbursed; artists can view net earnings in their Payouts dashboard.</p>
          <p>Vuka Music does not store payment card information. All payment data is handled by Paystack in accordance with PCI DSS standards.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="6. No Refund Policy">
          <p>All sales of digital goods on Vuka Music are final. We do not offer refunds once a purchase is confirmed and download access has been granted. This policy is consistent with the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 25 of 2002 (ECT Act), which permits sellers to exclude the right of return for digital goods delivered immediately upon purchase.</p>
          <p>If you believe you were charged incorrectly or did not receive access to your purchase, contact us at support@vukamusic.com within 7 days and we will investigate.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="7. Prohibited Conduct">
          <p>You may not: (a) upload content you do not own; (b) use automated tools to scrape, download, or rip content; (c) attempt to circumvent download protection or DRM measures; (d) resell or redistribute purchased digital files; (e) upload malware, spam, or illegal content; (f) harass, threaten, or abuse other users.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="8. DMCA & Takedowns">

        </Section>
